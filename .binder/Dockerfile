# Binder launcher for Underworld3
# Uses pre-built base image from GHCR
#
# The base image contains:
# - Pixi package manager with full runtime environment
# - Underworld3 built and installed
# - Start script that pulls latest code on launch
#
# This repo exists separately so mybinder.org can cache the image.
# Only update this when the base image version changes.
